# Blox

[![Build Status](https://github.com/yardnsm/blox-zsh-theme/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yardnsm/blox-zsh-theme/actions)

> Clean, modular ZSH theme

![](./.github/terminal.png)

Blox is a minimal and fast ZSH theme that shows you what you need. It consists of blocks, and you
can play with the order and change everything; it comes with some pre-defined blocks, but you can
create your own or even modify them.

---

## Install

This theme was tested on all the following methods, but it should be compatible with almost every
zsh framework / plugin manager.

### For antigen users

Simply add the following into your `~/.zshrc`

```console
antigen bundle yardnsm/blox-zsh-theme
```

### For zgen users

```console
zgen load yardnsm/blox-zsh-theme
```

### For antibody users

```console
antibody bundle yardnsm/blox-zsh-theme
```

### For oh-my-zsh users

1. Symlink (or copy) `blox.zsh` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/blox.zsh-theme`.
2. Set `ZSH_THEME="blox"` in your `.zshrc` file.

### Manual installation

1. Get the file `blox.zsh`; Either:

    - Clone this repo
    - ... or add it as a submodule.
    - Just download `blox.zsh`.

2. `source` it in your `~/.zshrc`:

    ```console
    source PATH_FOR_BLOX.zsh
    ```

## The prompt

![](./.github/terminal-sliced.png)

The main idea of this theme is dividing the prompt into blocks. The blocks are modular and they
could be arranged and modified. Each block has its options, which can also be customized. In
addition, each block has its own helper function so you can use them when you're building your own
blocks.

The following sections describe the built-in blocks and their customizing options.

### Core options

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| :------- | :------ | :------ |
| `BLOX_CONF__BLOCK_PREFIX` | `'['` | A block's prefix. Some blocks may use it. |
| `BLOX_CONF__BLOCK_SUFFIX` | `']'` | A block's suffix. Some blocks may use it. |
| `BLOX_CONF__BLOCK_SEPARATOR` | `' '` | The character used to separate blocks. |
| `BLOX_CONF__PROMPT_PREFIX` | `'\n'` | The prompt's prefix (the default adds a newline between prompts). |
| `BLOX_CONF__ONELINE` | `false` | **When setting to `true`, the lower segments will be disabled** |
| `BLOX_CONF__UNIFIED_PROMPT` | `false` | Set the to `true`, the entire rendered result will be assigned to `$PROMPT`. Otherwise, it'll render the upper segments separately (we recommend leaving it as `false` as it may solve some resizing issue, see [#2](https://github.com/yardnsm/blox-zsh-theme/issues/2)) |

## Further Customizing

### Setting the structure

The prompt consists of 4 segments: upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right. You can set
the value of each segment by simply change it's value. The value of a segment is an array of strings
representing the block's name.

:warning: **Note:** You can make the prompt oneline instead of multiline by changing the value of
`BLOX_CONF__ONELINE`. **This will disable the lower segments!**

| Variable | Default |
| :------- | :------ |
| `BLOX_SEG__UPPER_LEFT` | `( host cwd git exec_time )` |
| `BLOX_SEG__UPPER_RIGHT` | `( bgjobs nodejs pyenv virtualenv time )` |
| `BLOX_SEG__LOWER_LEFT` | `( symbol )` |
| `BLOX_SEG__LOWER_RIGHT` | `( )` |

### Creating blocks

A block is just a simple function that `echo`s the result. Some built-in blocks have their own helper
functions you can use when building your blocks (check the source code for more info).

The function name should match the naming convention of `blox_block__<name>`. For example:

```shell
function blox_block__helloworld() {
  echo "${BLOX_CONF__BLOCK_PREFIX}hello world${BLOX_CONF__BLOCK_SUFFIX}"
}
```

And add the block to the prompt:

```shell
BLOX_SEG__LOWER_RIGHT+=( helloworld )
```

Now you have a "hello world" block in the lower right segment of your prompt! So useful.

:warning: **Note:** there may be some spacing issues in the upper segments when using multiline mode.
To solve this, try wrapping variables (especially color variables, e.g. `$fg[...]`) within `%{…%}`
(see [this link](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Visual-effects) for
more details).
